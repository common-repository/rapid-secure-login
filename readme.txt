RapID Secure Login (RapID-SL) is a simple and convenient authentication plugin.

== Description ==
IMPORTANT: RapID-SL is now deprecated and cannot be used for new installations.
Existing credentials will continue to work until they expire (1 year after issuance) but cannot be renewed.
We would like to thank eveyone who has enjoyed using RapID-SL for the past few years, and will notify our user base should an alternative solution become available.

Enjoy hassle-free and secure user login to WordPress websites and blogs. RapID-SL combines simplicity with a great user experience, removing the need for vulnerable and inconvenient usernames and passwords.

###Benefits

* Simple "scan and fingerprint" interface – no need to type anything.
* Fast sign-up to blogs and websites.

###Features

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin directly through the WordPress add plugins admin page.
1. Install the RapID Secure Login app on your phone.
1. Use the app to scan the QR Code in the RapID Secure Login Plugin Settings Page.
1. Follow the instructions in the app to create a RapID account. 

Once registered, you can use your phone to log in to your WordPress site and to administer your account through the [RapID dashboard](https://rapidportal.intercede.com/)

Your site must have correctly configured support for OpenSSL. Please check with your hosting service provider if you are unsure.

If your WordPress site uses self-signed certificates to support https (during local development for example), it will not be possible to configure the site correctly, as the plugin will not be able to trust the endpoint where the certificates will be uploaded. The solution is to use a properly trusted certificate from a recognised certificate authority.

If your website uses a "privacy mode" or basic authentication to protect the WordPress administration area in addition to the normal WordPress login mechanism, it will not be possible for the plugin to configure the site correctly. The "privacy mode" or basic authentication will need to be turned off.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I log in to more than one account for each site? =

Yes - when the RapID Secure Login app sees that you have more than one credential on your phone for the site, it lets you choose the one you want.

= What happens if I lose or change my phone? =

It is important that you keep a record of your original password, or that you are able to request an administrator reset from the sites you register with. 

You can also have the app on more than one phone of course! Then you can log in again and re-register with your new phone. 

= Can I still log in if the RapID service goes down? =

Yes - the RapID Service is only used for creating your user credentials when you enrol. At the point of authentication, all messages are purely between the app and the WordPress site.

= Can I un-authorize a phone from my accounts? =

Yes - just log in to your account, edit your WordPress profile and you can remove enrolled phones from your account. The site administrator can also do this on your behalf.

= Does RapID know my passwords or user ID? =

No - RapID works independently of your passwords and user ID. You can change those and lock them away off-line!

When you create a RapID credential for your phone, the plugin internally generates a random unique identifier, which it associates with your WordPress ID. This random ID is the only WordPress account information the RapID app or service needs. Your actual ID and password are never sent outside your WordPress site.

= What does the service cost? =

Your first 1000 licenses are absolutely free. After that, it is just $50 for every 5000 licenses each year. No catches, no extra fees, just a secure WordPress login for all of your users, at a price that won't break the bank. Additional licenses can be purchased through the [RapID web site](https://rapidportal.intercede.com).

= Where can I get technical assistance? =

The [RapID Secure Login Web site and Support Forum](https://forums.intercede.com) helps you to find answers to technical questions and lets site administrators post enquiries and comments.
